[FFmpeg/libav](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Using%20libav*) is a collection of programs and libraries to deal with all
things related to audio & video.

This tutorial was born out of my own frustrations trying to learn, not only how video/audio work on a lower-level layer,
but also how to interact with FFmpeg in my own code.

Being an almost 20-year old project, a lot of the documentation, despite being incredibly detailed, is also highly
outdated and borderline incomprehensible sometimes. Searching for user questions leads mostly to old mailing list posts
that are rarely helpful.
I'll try my best to provide an up-to-date, beginner-friendly introduction to the topic. Here's what you can expect from
this series:

* Learning how video encoding/decoding works behind the curtains
* How to use ffmpeg's CLI
* Using FFmpeg's C API (libav)
* Learning some Rust along the way

All of the code shown is replicated entirely in my [rust-ffmpeg-examples](https://github.com/naps62/rust-ffmpeg-examples) git repo. Feel free to checkout the code.
Also feel free to hit me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/naps62) or via [email](mailto:mpalhas@gmail.com) if you feel
like it.
