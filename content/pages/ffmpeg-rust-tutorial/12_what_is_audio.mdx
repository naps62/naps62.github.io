Sound, in its purest form, is a vibration that propagates as a wave through a physical medium.

In digital form however, this analog signal needs to be digitized, through a process called [Pulse-code modulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-code_modulation).

This process is way out of scope here, but its enough to understand that it produces a digital version of an audio
signal.
Once you have that, the same principles used when thinking about video codecs can mostly be translated (or shall we say,
transmuxed? üòè) to audio as well.

As such, audio codecs will do analogous work to encode/decode audio signals, with varying degrees of quality,
compression, and compatibility. This tutorial won't delve too much into audio, though.

At least for now...
