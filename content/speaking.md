## Automating your Way to Confidence

**DevOps Lisbon (May 2020)**

A few months ago, Github Actions went to public beta, and it ended up fitting
our needs nicely. It also turned out that this CI has a lot more to offer than
I was previously used to. This talk is about our journey to make better and
faster releases, about how I'm trying to deprecate our project managers, and
about how awesome Github Actions can be.

care. We will discuss how they differ from traditional computing paradigms, how
to approach coding one, and how dangerous they can be.

## Mastering your Tools

**Pyconf Otto (2017, Florence Italy)**

This talk goes through some very practical advices about writing code
efficiently: ranging from useful and perhaps-not-so-well-known tools, to some
editor/terminal/OS configurations that I obsess over in order to tweak my
environment to perfection.
