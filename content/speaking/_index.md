## Let's fix our developer experience

**ETHGlobal Lisbon (May 2023)**

Like many others, I come from a web development background. And I miss the developer experience from those days. Short feedback loops and low cognitive load are the marks of a good DevEx. Foundry has come a long way to improve things, but a lot more can still be done, particularly for those who don't read EVM over breakfast.
This is the story of the inefficiencies I found, the legacy standards we still rely on, and the tools I'm building to address it.

## Automating your Way to Confidence

**DevOps Lisbon (May 2020)**

A few months ago, Github Actions went to public beta, and it ended up fitting
our needs nicely. It also turned out that this CI has a lot more to offer than
I was previously used to. This talk is about our journey to make better and
faster releases, about how I'm trying to deprecate our project managers, and
about how awesome Github Actions can be.

## Smart Contracts: A Beginner's Guide

**Pixels Camp 2019**

Let's talk blockchain! But not the whole money thing. Smart Contracts are the
real juice. I will walk you through what a Smart Contract is and why you should
care. We will discuss how they differ from traditional computing paradigms, how
to approach coding one, and how dangerous they can be.

## Mastering your Tools

**Pyconf Otto (2017, Florence Italy)**

This talk goes through some very practical advices about writing code
efficiently: ranging from useful and perhaps-not-so-well-known tools, to some
editor/terminal/OS configurations that I obsess over in order to tweak my
environment to perfection.
