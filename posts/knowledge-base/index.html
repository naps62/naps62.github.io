      <p>I've been trying to grow my own knowledge base for a long time now, by keeping
track of multiple notes taken from books, quotes, and other sources of
knowledge.</p>
<p>Now, and after a few iterations, I'm moving that to a more Unix-oriented
approach, which I'm presenting here.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR: I built my own terminal-based Zettelkasten system. Checkout the
Readme and source code <a href="https://github.com/naps62/zk">at Github</a>.</strong></p>
<h2 id="my-sources">My sources<a class="zola-anchor" href="#my-sources" aria-label="Anchor link for: my-sources">#</a></h2>
<p>I'm both the worst person at note taking, and the kind of person that needs
note-taking the most. My memory sucks, but so does my caligraphy.</p>
<p>Like most other people, I consume information from several different sources. Here's a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>Throughout my work (google searches, stack overflow, conversations, etc)</li>
<li>Books, which I mostly consume with my Kindle, and sometimes <a href="https://www.audible.com">Audible</a></li>
<li>Articles (via both <a href="https://feedly.com">Feedly</a> and <a href="https://app.getpocket.com">Pocket</a>)</li>
<li>Podcasts</li>
</ul>
<p>You may notice that I'm very digital-oriented. I do that both as a way to live
a more minimalistic lifestyle (less physical items + easier to travel), but also
to be able to retrieve information more easily.</p>
<p>Using my Kindle allows me to highlight any quote I want to save for later. Same
goes for my news feeds. Audible also has a clipping feature, although it's
a bit more awkward to use, and doesn't provide any kind of programatic access to
text. For more ad-hoc situations, such as a conversation, a quick note on
<a href="https://todoist.com">Todoist</a> also works really well.</p>
<p>Throughout my day, I want the ability to quickly highlight pieces of
information, with the least amount of friction possible.</p>
<p>Periodically, usually at the end of each month, I'll go through all new notes,
and organize them into my own knowledge base, with two main goals in mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>To condense any potentially useful knowledge in an accessible way</li>
<li>To go through everything a second time (or more), to consolidate knowledge.</li>
</ol>
<p>Whenever I, later on, want to remind myself of a particular concept, or even
find a particular quote or definition to include in a talk I'm building, I'll
often go back to this knowledge base. I'll also make a point to revisit notes
for a particular book at some point in the future, doing a slightly informal
version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">Spaced
Repetition</a></p>
<p>So here's how I built this knowledge base:</p>
<h2 id="first-draft-notion">First draft: Notion<a class="zola-anchor" href="#first-draft-notion" aria-label="Anchor link for: first-draft-notion">#</a></h2>
<p>My first version of this knowledge base was built with
<a href="https://notion.so">Notion</a>.</p>
<p>Notion is a text editor with superpowers. It allows me to create whatever
hierarchy I want. It supports full-text search. And works on all platforms
without any extra effort, meaning I can have my knowledge available at all
times.</p>
<p>I can create a page for each book I read:</p>
<p><img src="https://naps62.com/posts/knowledge-base/./notion-index.png" alt="notion index" /></p>
<p>And within those pages, I can use a markdown-like syntax to list highlights:</p>
<p><img src="https://naps62.com/posts/knowledge-base/./notion-thinking-systems.png" alt="notion systems" /></p>
<p>But this didn't fit my own workflow very easily.</p>
<p>I'm a long-time linux user, and I've come to learn how to be productive with
tools that I have available on my terminal. So it made sense to me that my
knowledge base should be accessible on my terminal as well, and taking advantage
of the tools that I already know and love.</p>
<p>This also allowed me to build some custom features that I've been wanting for
some time.</p>
<p>Which is why I build my own zettelkasten setup.</p>
<h2 id="a-zettelkasten">A Zettelkasten<a class="zola-anchor" href="#a-zettelkasten" aria-label="Anchor link for: a-zettelkasten">#</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>a knowledge management and note-taking method used in research and study</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten">Wikipedia</a></em></p>
<p>I've actually only learned of this name recently, when reading <a href="https://superorganizers.substack.com/p/how-to-build-a-learning-machine">a blog
post</a> that ended up being one of the inspirations for this
work.</p>
<p>A zettelkasten is a personal knowledge base. The name is of german origin,
&quot;Zettel&quot; meaning note, and &quot;Kasten&quot; meaning box.</p>
<p>It's not a concrete methodology, or a specific way of organizing information.
It's nothing more than a metaphorical box of notes.</p>
<h2 id="a-unix-based-zettelkasten">A unix-based zettelkasten<a class="zola-anchor" href="#a-unix-based-zettelkasten" aria-label="Anchor link for: a-unix-based-zettelkasten">#</a></h2>
<p>To this end, I ended up building my own set of scripts to manage a knowledge
base, by stitching together multiple tools that are already part of my daily
workflow.</p>
<h3 id="notes-as-markdown">Notes as markdown<a class="zola-anchor" href="#notes-as-markdown" aria-label="Anchor link for: notes-as-markdown">#</a></h3>
<p>Each note is represented as a single markdown file.</p>
<p>Markdown is intuitive enough to use in the context of a terminal, and syntax
highglighting allows me to leverage it for a few extra things, as we'll see</p>
<p>Here's an example of a real note from my knowledge base:</p>
<pre data-lang="markdown" class="language-markdown "><code class="language-markdown" data-lang="markdown"># Recalcitrance

#definition #ai
</code></pre>
<p>This is a short one. A definition of a word. One that I learned while reading
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20527133-superintelligence">Superintelligence</a>
a few years ago.</p>
<p>I chose to use hashtags, such as <code>#definition</code> to tag each note as I see fit,
but also to specify sources using <code>@</code>.</p>
<p>This allows me build tooling to search for both tags and sources, and quickly
find what I'm looking for.</p>
<p>This note is also not static. If I come back to it, I'm free to edit it as I see
fit, or even add new tags, if I want to relate it with some newfound idea
present somewhere else in the base.</p>
<h3 id="see-it-in-action">See it in action<a class="zola-anchor" href="#see-it-in-action" aria-label="Anchor link for: see-it-in-action">#</a></h3>
<p>Here's a quick rundown of what I have so far:</p>
<ol>
<li>The knowledge base is pointed to by <code>$ZK_PATH</code>;</li>
<li><code>zk new &lt;title&gt;</code> creates a new note;</li>
<li><code>zk tags</code> starts an interactive fuzzy search across all existing tags;</li>
<li><code>zk sources</code> does the same thing, but for sources instead;</li>
<li><code>zk search</code> starts a full text search on the entire knowledge base.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://naps62.com/posts/knowledge-base/./zk-in-action.gif" alt="zk in action" /></p>
<p>PS: As I mentioned, most of this is inspired by <a href="https://superorganizers.substack.com/p/how-to-build-a-learning-machine">this
article</a>. The author <a href="https://github.com/sirupsen/zk">built and open-sourced</a> his
own system using very similar tools as the ones I did.</p>
<p>Curious about what's underneath all this? It's actually fairly simple:</p>
<h4 id="git">Git<a class="zola-anchor" href="#git" aria-label="Anchor link for: git">#</a></h4>
<p>The knowledge base itself is a <code>git</code> repo. Assuming you're a developer (or
similar role), this should not require any further explanation. 😄</p>
<h4 id="vim">Vim<a class="zola-anchor" href="#vim" aria-label="Anchor link for: vim">#</a></h4>
<p>My editor of choice. Since this is, at the moment, made for personal use,
I haven't focused on supporting anything else, as I have no need for it</p>
<h4 id="ripgrep">Ripgrep<a class="zola-anchor" href="#ripgrep" aria-label="Anchor link for: ripgrep">#</a></h4>
<p>Remember what I said about searching for tags or sources?</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep"><code>ripgrep</code></a> is an extremely fast full-text search tool.</p>
<p>I can build a search for tags (words starting with <code>#</code>) with something like the
following:</p>
<pre data-lang="sh" class="language-sh "><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">rg --only-matching &quot;#[\w\-_]{3,}&quot; --type md ...
</code></pre>
<h4 id="fzf">Fzf<a class="zola-anchor" href="#fzf" aria-label="Anchor link for: fzf">#</a></h4>
<p>Fzf is a fuzzy-finder which, when coupled with ripgrep, provides a great
interactive and real-time search environment right in my terminal</p>
<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up<a class="zola-anchor" href="#wrapping-up" aria-label="Anchor link for: wrapping-up">#</a></h2>
<p>This system is still in its early stages (in fact, I'm still in the process of
migrating some notes from Notion).
It does look very promising though, since I find myself using it a lot more
often just because it sits right there in my terminal.</p>
